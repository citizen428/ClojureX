I wanted a good way to get "Clojure":http://clojure.org set up on Mac OS X.

Based on the instructions I read at "Mark Reid's Blog":http://mark.reid.name/sap/setting-up-clojure.html I created this project to pull everything into one place.

I made some changes and assumptions.
# You've already got java 1.6 set up and are using it as your default java from command line.
# You will put the /bin directory in this project in your path so you don't have to set any other environment variables.
## Or you will symlink to it.  Either way you shouldn't have to set anything else up.
